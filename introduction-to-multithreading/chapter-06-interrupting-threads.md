# Chapter 6: Interrupting Threads

In Java, interrupting a thread involves setting a flag that suggests the thread should stop execution. This mechanism is particularly useful when a long-running task needs to be aborted or when shutting down a multi-threaded application gracefully.

## InterruptedException

You will come across this exception being thrown from functions. When a thread `wait()`s or `sleep()`s then one way for it to give up waiting/sleeping is it to be interrupted. If a thread is interrupted while waiting/sleeping, it'll wake up and immediately throw InterruptedException.

The `Thread` class exposes the `interrupt()` method which can be used to interrupt a thread that is blocked in a `sleep()` or `wait()` call.

Below is an example, where a thread is initially made to sleep for an hour but then interrupted by the main thread.

```java
package com.completeinterview.multithreading;

class InterruptExample {
  public static void example() throws InterruptedException {
    Thread thread =
        new Thread(
            () -> {
              try {
                System.out.println("Sleepy thread, Sleeping for an hour");
                Thread.sleep(1000 * 60 * 60);
              } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
                System.out.println(
                    "The interrupt flag is cleared : "
                        + Thread.interrupted()
                        + " "
                        + Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted());
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                System.out.println("Ohh someone woke me up.");
                System.out.println(
                    "The interrupt flag is set now : "
                        + Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()
                        + " "
                        + Thread.interrupted());
              }
            });

    thread.start();
    System.out.println("Waking up a sleeping thread by invoking interrupt() method.");
    thread.interrupt();
    System.out.println("Woke up sleepy thread.");
    thread.join();
  }
}

public class Driver {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
    InterruptExample.example();
  }
}
```

### Output
```
Waking up a sleeping thread by invoking interrupt() method.
Woke up sleepy thread.
Sleepy thread, Sleeping for an hour
The interrupt flag is cleared : false false
Ohh someone woke me up.
The interrupt flag is set now : true true
```

### Explanation

- When `thread.interrupt()` is called from main thread, the interrupt flag of the thread is set to true.
- The sleeping thread is interrupted, so an `InterruptedException` is thrown. At this point, the interrupt flag is cleared automatically by the JVM, as per the contract of `InterruptedException`.
- And that's the reason `false false` is printed. (You might be expecting `true true`).
- Then we executed `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()`, but this time no `InterruptedException` is thrown because after the thread was interrupted and the `InterruptedException` was thrown, the thread is no longer in a blocking state.

An `InterruptedException` is thrown only when a thread is interrupted while it is in a blocking state, such as:
- `Thread.sleep()`
- `Object.wait()`
- `Thread.join()`
- `BlockingQueue.put()` or `take()`

Setting the interrupt flag (Thread.currentThread().interrupt()) only marks the thread as interruptedâ€”it doesn't directly throw an exception unless the thread performs a blocking operation again.
